# arch-auto-install

A bash script that installs Arch Linux for my personal needs. It is part of my custom Archiso.

## ~/.automated_script.sh
This is the entry point of the automated installation of Arch Linux. It is located at the root home directory of the corresponding iso-image.
The script clones this repository and executes `auto-install.sh`.

## auto-install.sh
This script basically wraps the commands listed in the ArchWiki.
